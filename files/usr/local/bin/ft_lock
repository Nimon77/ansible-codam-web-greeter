# The ft_lock package was replaced by codam-web-greeter at Codam.

# so this file redirects the command to dm-tool, which calls the greeter.
# The greeter knows from the list of active sessions that it should act as
# a lock screen instead of a login screen.

# If the -d flag is given, the ft_lock daemon was tried to be started.
# This is not needed anymore, so exit with success.
